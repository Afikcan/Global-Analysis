# Exploring the Intersection of Religion, Education, and Economic Welfare: A Global Analysis
This study explores the intricate relationship between religiousness, educational attainment, and economic welfare, as reflected in the Human Development Index (HDI), across five countries: Norway, Australia, Saudi Arabia, India, and Afghanistan. Utilizing datasets spanning 1990 to 2010, the analysis focuses on identifying correlations between non-religiosity, education, and HDI. The study employs dimension reduction, correlation analysis, and regression models to extract meaningful insights. Findings reveal diverse relationships between these factors across different socio-cultural contexts. The study highlights the complexity of societal development and the nuanced roles played by education and religious beliefs in shaping it. This research provides valuable perspectives for policymakers and contributes to the broader understanding of global human development dynamics.
